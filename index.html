                <p>Taking a step back to reflect, this course did an excellent job introducing me to the process of design thinking and how utilizing design thinking toolkits and mindsets can help me better solve complex, interdisciplinary problems. I generally think that the principles of design thinking ought to be integrated or further emphasized in the product design process at companies and engineering programs at universities. </p>
                <p>I particularly enjoyed the case studies provided as part of this course.</p>

                <p>Despite my acknowledgement and support for the design thinking process, I am not totally sold on the idea of design thinking becoming a “movement.” It is touted as the next big thing and its adoption has begun, but there is not widespread support from even the design community on its perceived greatness. Whether or not I refute or accept the design thinking movement depends on how it is defined. </p>

                <h4>Why I am:</h4>
                <p>I am a design thinker in the sense that everyone who practices the principles of design thinking is a design thinker. The major time that I have used my design thinking skills was during my team sprint project in this course. My team worked together to design a solution to workplace communications issues that have arisen from the work from home policies amid the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>

                <h4>Why I am not:</h4>
                <p>I am not a design thinker in the sense that I do not follow the design thinking process at work. In my day-to-day tasks at work, I am mostly consumed by solving problems of a highly technical nature. In my current role, I am entirely focused on the implementation of the pieces of an autonomous vehicle. Very little of the design from the human-centered side is shared with me, let alone having an input into it. So, for the majority of my time, I dive in with my technical problem solving skills at work and lack a need to put on my design thinking “hat” when I am working on code. I think that the problems I have to solve as an individual contributor are not compatible with much of the design thinking process. </p>

                <p>In my current role, there are times at work where we are given the opportunity to work on anything that we want during a week-long hackathon. I see this as a chance to apply some of the design thinking skills that I have acquired in a week-long sprint. In that time, I can do a deep dive into the challenges that face our customers and try to investigate and prototype solutions that meet their needs. The free nature of a hackathon would allow me to explore the design thinking process in a professional setting that is not typically available to me.</p>
                <p>In my future roles, I am interested in exploring more of the system-wide view to autonomous vehicles and systems. Rather than just the minute technical details, I want to design and focus on the big picture. How will our customers interact with the autonomous vehicle? How does a farmer manage his or her fleet of vehicles? What can we do to make our customer’s lives easier? I think these types of questions and the role that I want to be in eventually lends itself better to utilizing design thinking more often than my current role.</p>
