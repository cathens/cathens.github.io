                <p>Taking a step back to reflect, this course did an excellent job introducing me to the process of design thinking and how utilizing design thinking toolkits and mindsets can help me better solve complex, interdisciplinary problems. I generally think that the principles of design thinking ought to be integrated or further emphasized in the product design process at companies and engineering programs at universities. </p>
                <p>I particularly enjoyed the emphasis on case studies in this course. To me, these spoke louder than the sources from academia. Each case study in the course left me with new insights into design thinking. </p>
                <p>From IDEO and the shopping cart, I learned the value of rapid prototyping and the need to bring the stakeholders in the process. From the Good Kitchen, I learned how exploring the problem space in addition to the solution space can bring about solutions that would have not been thought of otherwise. From Me You Health, I was reminded of the importance of creating personas during the process to keep the design grounded on the intended users. From airbnb, I learned how the visual aspect of the design can have great effects on the users. Finally, from a case study I sought out in the course, IDEO’s and Google’s collaboration on Project Bloks, I learned the value of learning to design for others who are not like yourself. From these case studies, I had some of my biggest takeaways from the course.</p>

                <p>Despite my acknowledgement and support for the design thinking process, I am not totally sold on the idea of design thinking becoming a “movement.” Perhaps my criticism is of the word “movement” being used too loosely. It is touted as the next big thing and its adoption has begun in some places, but there is not widespread support from even within the design community. Whether or not I refute or accept the design thinking movement depends on how it is defined. Do I think it is a good process to guide people (especially people not trained in design) to design better? Yes. Do I think it will bring widespread change into how our products and services are created? No.</p>
                <p>I think Jared Spool’s idea of “design thinking is a reframing of design” is particularly insightful. The packaging of “basic, proven tools of design to the maximum effect” provides a simple way for others to understand design best practices. With my background with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, design was not stressed in my curriculum, so a lot of what might be common knowledge is design was not known to me. As Spool says, “there’s no magic in design thinking” because there is not much new or special to it. Just that other people who are not designers are starting to take note of it. That does not sound like a movement to me. I would consider design thinking a successful rebranding of other design processes.</p>
                <p>John Maeda of Automattic gave a counter-argument for the design-led approach that design thinking brings. A former design advocate who gave a TED Talk on the intersection of simplicity, technology, and art, Maeda says, “Design is not that important.” While this statement may seem sensationalist, it makes more sense when he goes further and says, “If you can’t work with developers, you’re not going to make a dent in the universe.” Maeda now advocates for design to take a supporting role in technology companies to ensure that engineering takes precedence. As he notes, good design does not matter if the engineering and science is not there to back it up. I understand his sentiment, but there does have to be a balance of the two as one can not do well without the other. Maeda just supports my idea that design thinking may not be a movement especially since he did such a 180 degree change on his stance on the role of design.</p>

                <h4>Why I am:</h4>
                <p>I am a design thinker in the sense that everyone who practices the principles of design thinking is a design thinker. The major time that I have used my design thinking skills was during my team sprint project in this course. My team worked together to design a solution to workplace communications issues that have arisen from the work from home policies amid the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>

                <h4>Why I am not:</h4>
                <p>I am not a design thinker in the sense that I do not follow the design thinking process at work. In my day-to-day tasks at John Deere, I am mostly consumed by solving problems of a highly technical nature. In my current role, I am entirely focused on the implementation of the pieces of an autonomous vehicle. Very little of the design from the human-centered side is shared with me, let alone having an input into it. In our organizational structure, I am very far away from the customer. I only interact with the people who know the needs of the customer, so it is all second hand knowledge. </p>
                <p>So, for the majority of my time, I dive in with my technical problem solving skills at work and lack a need to put on my design thinking “hat” when I am working on code. I think that the problems I have to solve as an individual contributor are not compatible with much of the design thinking process. </p>

              <div class="card-content">
                <p>In my current role, there are times at work where we are given the opportunity to work on anything that we want during a week-long hackathon. I see this as a chance to apply some of the design thinking skills that I have acquired in a week-long sprint. In that time, I can do a deep dive into the challenges that face our customers and try to investigate and prototype solutions that meet their needs. The free nature of a hackathon would allow me to explore the design thinking process in a professional setting that is not typically available to me.</p>
                <p>In my future roles, I am interested in exploring more of the system-wide view to autonomous vehicles and systems. Rather than just the minute technical details, I want to design and focus on the big picture. How will our customers interact with the autonomous vehicle? How does a farmer manage his or her fleet of vehicles? What can we do to make our customer’s lives easier? I think these types of questions and the role that I want to be in eventually lends itself better to utilizing design thinking more often than my current role.</p>
                <p>I think this class has really helped me understand the importance of humanistic design which will help me as I progress in my career. Understanding who will use the product, service, or system that I am designing needs to be at the forefront of my mind as I work and not in the background. Even now, when I may just really be writing code, I can do a better job to try to understand my customers so I can create something better. </p>

                <p>I enjoy more freedom in an academic setting than in the workplace. My newly acquired and fine-tuned design thinking skills can be applied more broadly in my potential classes and research. I think the way my team worked through our design sprint could be applied to my other group projects. Usually at the end of my graduate courses, there is a project where I am tasked with creating something. I have an interest in human factors and human-computer interaction where I think the design thinking process could successfully be applied.</p>
